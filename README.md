# heroesAnalysis
This repository contains the code and other resources to analyze data for the fictional game "Heroes of Pymoli". The goal with this project is to be able to relate useful data back to the developer about users buying habits and tendencies for paid in-game items.

After running my analysis code on this data I noticed 3 things:

1. An overwhelming majority of the player base is male, with 84% of all players identifying as such. Males also account for 82% of total sales in the game. Given this data you could either lean into this fact and try to make your items and powerups more appealing to male players, or try and change the marketing and certain other aspects of the game in order to bring in more female/other player and diversify your player base.

2. Another area where one demo dominates is in the age groups. The majority of the games userbase is between 15-24, with that age group accounting for 63% of the player base. It may be a good idea to look at some strategies to make the game more appealing to older demos, who may have more money to use on the game.

3. Overall jusdging by the Users purchase count data it doesnt seem like players are purchasing very many items at all. THe highest number of items purchased by a single user is just 5. Id take a hard look at the in game items and try to make them more appealing to player, like lowering the price or making them more useful in gameplay, so you can attempt to bump up sales.
